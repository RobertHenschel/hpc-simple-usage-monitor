# Simple Usage Monitor for HPC Desktops
The goal of this application is to make users aware of their resource consumption (CPU cycles and memory) when running in the shared environment of an HPC Desktop. The application shows a users CPU and memory consumption (in blue) in relation to the resource consumption of all other users on the same system. The main window of the tool can be configured in 3 views, full (see below), without legend and minimal. The tool has a system tray widget that changes color from green to orange to red as a users resource consumption increases.
